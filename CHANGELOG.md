# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Features marked with **[Pro]** are available in the pro edition only and are excluded from the community sync.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **[Pro]** Atomic quota enforcement — `checkAndRecordUsage` replaces non-atomic `checkQuota` + `recordUsage` with single DynamoDB `ConditionExpression` to eliminate TOCTOU race at quota boundary
- **[Pro]** `conditionalIncrementUsage` repository method using DynamoDB conditional writes
- DynamoDB `WriteThrottleEvents` CloudWatch alarm to detect batch write data loss risk
- Sync integrity verification step in `.sync/sync.sh` — scans for pro-only file leaks before pushing to community repo
- Backend CI coverage enforcement (`--coverage` flag on backend tests, `--cov-fail-under=70` on Python tests)
- Python type checking in CI via mypy
- Backend unit tests for dynamodb client, finnhub service, mlSentiment service, newsCache service, signalScore service, and 7 utility modules (cache, cacheTransform, dynamodb, error, hash, logger, metrics)

### Changed

- Migrated from deprecated `@testing-library/jest-native` to built-in matchers in `@testing-library/react-native`
- Pinned `react-test-renderer` as direct devDependency to keep in sync with React via Dependabot
- Moved Lambda `MemorySize`/`Timeout` from SAM `Globals` to per-function config for right-sized resources
- Scoped SES IAM policy from `Resource: '*'` to specific identity ARN
- Escalated `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` from `warn` to `error`
- Routed `console.log` calls through logger utility
- Removed 14 unused type exports across frontend and backend
- Removed unused Python exports and whitelisted tested-but-uncalled functions

### Fixed

- Frontend CI failures on Dependabot PRs caused by `react-test-renderer` version mismatch
- `TierContext` defaulting `isFeatureEnabled` to `false` for unauthenticated users — now returns `true` per auth-optional design
- `MaterialityHeatmap` initializing to current month instead of data's month, causing time-dependent test failures
- 9 npm audit vulnerabilities resolved
- Removed committed `__pycache__` bytecode from tracking

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Fix race condition between release and sync workflows — sync now creates community repo tag and release directly instead of depending on pro repo tag propagation

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **[Pro]** Model diagnostics — ML prediction feature importance percentages per horizon, converting raw ANOVA F-statistics into relative percentages grouped into Sentiment Signals and Price Signals
- **[Pro]** Materiality heatmap — calendar grid on portfolio cards showing daily sentiment intensity (color-coded) with material event dot markers, backwards pagination via `useInfiniteQuery`
- **[Pro]** Comparative sentiment — stock sentiment percentile ranking vs sector ETF top 10 holdings, with three-level ETF holdings fallback (DynamoDB cache → yfinance → static map)
- **[Pro]** Email reports — personalized HTML email digests via SES with portfolio summaries, predictions, sentiment, and track record; on-demand delivery + weekly EventBridge schedule (Monday 8 AM UTC)
- **[Pro]** `GET /etf-holdings` endpoint with ETF holdings cache (`ETF#` entity, 7-day TTL)
- **[Pro]** `GET /sentiment/peers` endpoint with peer sentiment cache (`PEERS#` entity, 24-hour TTL)
- **[Pro]** `GET /sentiment/daily-history` endpoint reading pre-aggregated `DAILY#` entities
- **[Pro]** `GET/PUT /reports/preferences` and `POST /reports/send` email report endpoints (auth + tier required)
- **[Pro]** `REPORT_PREFS` DynamoDB entity for weekly report opt-in and ticker list
- **[Pro]** 4 new feature flags: `model_diagnostics`, `materiality_heatmap`, `comparative_sentiment`, `email_reports`
- **[Pro]** `SES_FROM_EMAIL` environment variable for configurable sender address

### Fixed

- Peer sentiment `batchFetchAverageSentiment` reading nonexistent `sentimentScore` field — changed to `avgAspectScore ?? avgMlScore`
- Report handler missing tier enforcement — free-tier users now receive 403 on report endpoints
- Report handler error responses leaking raw exception messages — now uses `sanitizeErrorMessage()`
- Report HTML template missing escaping for user-derived strings (`escapeHtml()` applied)
- Report `priceChange` never populated — now fetches 2 price records and computes delta
- Report `peerPercentile` referenced but never populated — removed dead field from interface and template
- ETF holdings handler leaking raw Python exception in 500 responses
- ETF holdings handler not validating `etf` query parameter format — added `^[A-Z]{1,6}$` regex
- ETF holdings handler/service passing dead `table_name` argument — removed
- Peer sentiment handler missing `validateTicker()` — now validates both `ticker` and `sectorEtf`
- Peer sentiment handler `sectorName` unbounded — capped at 50 characters
- Daily-history handler missing `validateTicker()` — now uses shared validation
- Comparative sentiment bar width overflow — clamped to 100% max
- Heatmap prev-month button missing `disabled` state when no more data
- Weekly report processing changed from sequential to parallel batches of 10

## [2.2.2] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md and API.md with v2.2 feature documentation (sentiment velocity, sector benchmarking, earnings calendar, notes, track record)
- Updated community overlay docs to include public features and reference pro for gated features
- Marked implemented features in PRO_FEATURES_ROADMAP.md

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- Automated community repo GitHub release creation via sync workflow

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **[Pro]** Sentiment velocity indicator — shows rate of change in daily sentiment scores with directional arrows and magnitude badges
- **[Pro]** Stock notes — per-stock notes with DynamoDB primary storage and local SQLite fallback for offline use; full CRUD with cloud sync on app open
- **[Pro]** Sector ETF benchmarking — GICS sector-to-SPDR ETF mapping (11 sectors), sector/industry metadata enrichment via yfinance, relative performance comparison on price screen
- **[Pro]** Earnings calendar — upcoming earnings dates with BMO/AMC/TNS timing, EPS estimates, batch endpoint, DynamoDB cache with 24-hour TTL and empty sentinel for ETFs
- **[Pro]** Prediction track record — immutable prediction snapshots (`PRED#` DynamoDB entity), on-demand resolution against actual prices, per-horizon accuracy gauges (1d/14d/30d), prediction history with correct/incorrect/pending indicators
- **[Pro]** `POST /predictions/snapshot` endpoint for browser-side prediction tracking
- **[Pro]** `GET /predictions/track-record` endpoint with stats aggregation and recent predictions
- **[Pro]** Notes CRUD endpoints (`GET/POST /notes`, `PUT/DELETE /notes/:noteId`)
- **[Pro]** Earnings endpoints (`GET /earnings`, `POST /batch/earnings`)
- Trading day utility functions (weekend-aware date arithmetic, UTC-anchored)
- SQLite migrations v5 (notes table) and v6 (sector columns on symbol_details)
- 5 new feature flags: `sentiment_velocity`, `stock_notes`, `sector_benchmarking`, `earnings_calendar`, `prediction_track_record`
- Implementation plan documentation in `docs/plans/` (Phase 0-3)

### Fixed

- Notes sync: PUT→404 fallback to POST for notes edited before first sync
- Notes sync: ID mismatch causing duplicate notes after sync (frontend now sends local ID to backend)
- Notes sync: `createBackendClient()` moved outside sync loop
- Earnings cache: deferred `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME` check for testability
- Track record: parallel DynamoDB resolution via `Promise.all()`
- Track record: per-horizon recent predictions (7 per horizon, merged by date)
- Prediction snapshots: ticker validated against real stock data; basePriceClose required

### Changed

- ESLint upgraded to v9 with flat config
- Sync config updated to exclude notes and track record backend files from community edition
- Community sync boundary documented: earnings, sector, and velocity intentionally available in community (public data, no auth required)
